//! Core types for the liquidation engine.
//!
//! Pure data — no I/O, no allocation. Every type is `Copy`-friendly so the
//! engine can be invoked on snapshots taken at the bridge layer without
//! lifetime gymnastics. The convention follows `rdk-funding`: the
//! liquidation crate never owns mutable state in Stage 10a; it computes
//! over snapshots that the caller assembled.
//!
//! ### Why fixed-point integers, not floats
//!
//! Same answer as `rdk-funding`: consensus determinism. Every validator
//! must reach the same `MarginHealth` from the same inputs, and float
//! arithmetic varies bit-for-bit across compilers and CPUs. We use signed
//! integers scaled by [`MARGIN_SCALE`] (basis points, 10⁴) for margin
//! ratios.
