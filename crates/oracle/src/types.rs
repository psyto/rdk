//! Core types for the oracle (Stage 11).
//!
//! Pure data — every type is `Copy`-friendly so the aggregation engine
//! can be invoked on stack-allocated observation slices without lifetime
//! gymnastics. Follows the rdk convention: the crate never owns
//! mutable state in its types; mutation lives in [`crate::state`].
//!
//! ### What an oracle does, in one paragraph
//!
//! A perpetual-DEX index oracle aggregates spot-price observations from
//! several external publishers (typically major-CEX feeds) into one
//! canonical index price the rest of the system trusts. The aggregation
//! must be deterministic across validators (every node arrives at the
//! same number from the same inputs), robust to single-feed manipulation
//! (one bad publisher shouldn't move the index), and bounded against
//! stale data (a feed that hasn't updated in N seconds is dropped). The
//! result is what `rdk_funding::compute_premium` consumes against the
//! CLOB-derived mark price to compute the per-interval funding rate.
