//! Core types for the vault primitive (Stage 12).
//!
//! Pure data — every type is `Copy`-friendly so the engine can be
//! invoked on stack-allocated values without lifetime gymnastics.
//! Follows the rdk convention: the crate never owns mutable state
//! in its types; mutation lives in [`crate::state`].
//!
//! ### What a vault is, in one paragraph
//!
//! A vault pools many depositors' collateral into one fungible "share"
//! token. Each depositor's claim on the underlying assets is denominated
//! in shares: their slice of the vault grows or shrinks proportionally
//! as the vault's positions accrue `PnL`. New depositors mint shares at
//! the current NAV (net asset value per share); withdrawers burn shares
//! and receive their pro-rata slice of current assets. The vault
//! manager runs trading strategies on the pooled collateral; the
//! depositors never see individual positions, only share-denominated
//! exposure to the manager's performance.
//!
//! ### Share accounting, in one paragraph
//!
//! At inception a vault has zero shares and zero assets. The first
//! depositor's `assets` get them an equal number of shares (1:1
//! mint). Every subsequent depositor's shares are minted in proportion
//! to the **current** assets-per-share ratio:
//!
//! ```text
//!   shares_minted = assets × total_shares / total_assets
//! ```
//!
//! After a withdrawal,
//!
//! ```text
//!   assets_returned = shares × total_assets / total_shares
//! ```
//!
//! Both formulas round toward zero (floor for positive numerators),
//! which slightly favors the *remaining* shareholders — the standard
//! ERC-4626 convention. Stage 12 v0 implements this directly with
//! i128 intermediates to avoid overflow on `assets × total_shares`.
