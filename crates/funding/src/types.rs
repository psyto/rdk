//! Core types for the funding state machine.
//!
//! Pure data — no I/O, no allocation beyond what's needed for settlements.
//! Every type is `Copy`-friendly (or, in the case of `Position`, `Clone +
//! Copy`) so callers can pass snapshots without lifetime gymnastics.
//!
//! ### Why fixed-point integers, not floats
//!
//! Consensus determinism — every validator must compute the *same* funding
//! rate from the *same* inputs. Float arithmetic gives different bit patterns
//! across compilers and CPUs (FMA, rounding mode, denormal handling); the
//! moment two validators disagree on a single LSB they fork. We use signed
//! integers scaled by [`RATE_SCALE`] (parts-per-billion) for rates and
//! premiums, and a separate `Notional` type for quote-currency deltas.
