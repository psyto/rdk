//! `rdk-clearing` — per-account position bookkeeping under CLOB fills.
//!
//! Pure state machine. Given an [`Account`] and a fill at `(price, qty,
//! side)`, [`apply_fill`] mutates the account in place and returns the
//! signed quote-currency PnL realized by the fill (`0` if the fill only
//! opened or increased the position, non-zero only when contracts were
//! closed).
//!
//! ### What this crate is, in one paragraph
//!
//! Hyperliquid-shape perpetuals settle in two parallel mechanisms:
//! continuous price exposure via the *position* (size + avg_entry) and
//! periodic cash transfers via funding ([`rdk_funding`]). When a
//! CLOB fill matches a maker and a taker, both accounts' positions
//! must update: the avg_entry of any increase is a volume-weighted
//! mean, and any decrease realizes PnL at `qty × (fill_price −
//! avg_entry)`, signed by the side being decreased. This crate
//! formalizes that math as a pure function so every validator that
//! consumes the same fill sequence reaches the same per-account
//! state — the determinism guarantee the rest of rdk already
//! depends on.
//!
//! ### Why a separate crate
//!
//! `rdk-clob` produces fills; `rdk-funding` consumes positions;
//! `rdk-liquidation` consumes account snapshots; `rdk-vault`
//! holds collateral. None of them owns the "what does a fill do to my
//! position?" rule — that gap is what this crate fills.
//!
//! ### What this crate is NOT
//!
//! - **A holder of mutable account state.** The owning layer (bridge,
//!   eventual clearing house) is responsible for keeping accounts on
//!   disk + replaying fills against them. This crate is the pure
//!   `(state, input) → state` math.
//! - **A fee model.** Maker rebates, taker fees, exchange fees — all
//!   bridge-layer concerns. `apply_fill` returns the raw realized PnL;
//!   the caller subtracts fees if applicable.
//! - **A funding settler.** Funding settlement adjusts collateral on
//!   a separate cadence; see [`rdk_funding::FundingClock`].

///    qty)`. No realized PnL.
///
/// 3. **Decrease opposite direction, partial close** (`sign(position)
///    != sign(side)` and `qty < |position|`): position shrinks by
///    `qty`; `avg_entry` stays at the existing basis (closing
///    contracts doesn't change the entry basis of the remainder).
///    Realized PnL = `qty × (fill_price − avg_entry)` for a long
///    being closed (Sell against a long); `qty × (avg_entry −
///    fill_price)` for a short being closed (Buy against a short).
///
/// 4. **Flip** (`sign(position) != sign(side)` and `qty >
///    |position|`): existing position closes fully (realize PnL on
///    the old size), then a new position opens in the opposite
///    direction with the remaining quantity (`qty − |position|`) at
///    `avg_entry = fill_price`.
///
/// ### Integer arithmetic
///
/// All operations are `i128`-widened and `saturating_*` so a
/// malicious overflow can't fork the chain. The final result is
/// narrowed back to `i64`/`u64`. Same conventions as
