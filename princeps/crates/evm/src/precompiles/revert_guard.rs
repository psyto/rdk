//! `PrincepsRevertGuard` — REVM `Inspector` that rolls back precompile
//! mutations when the calling EVM frame reverts.
//!
//! ### The bug it closes
//!
//! Stage 17c–17e shipped the deposit/withdraw precompiles and
//! Stage 9c shipped `clob_place_order`. All three mutate
//! process-global state ([`super::ACCOUNTS_STATE`], [`super::CLOB_STATE`],
//! [`super::FILL_SINK`]) directly. If a contract calls the precompile
//! and then `REVERT`s — or hits any other failure mode the EVM
//! rolls back — the precompile's mutation **stays**. The bridge's
//! view drifts from the EVM's view, and a malicious contract can
//! mint collateral by depositing inside a reverted call.
//!
//! ### What this inspector does
//!
//! Pushes a [`BridgeStateSnapshot`] onto a per-EVM stack on every
//! `call` entry. On `call_end`, pops the snapshot; if the call
//! reverted, restores. The behaviour mirrors REVM's own journaling
//! of storage slots — every call frame is a savepoint, every
//! revert rewinds to it.
//!
//! v0 takes whole-state snapshots (clone the entire accounts map +
//! CLOB book + pending-fills buffer per call). For the 5-account
//! dev seed that's noise; for production it should evolve to
//! per-mutation journal entries the way REVM's storage journal
//! works. Out of scope here.
//!
//! ### Scope of Stage 17i
//!
//! This crate provides the **mechanism + tests**. Production wiring
//! (replacing the `NoOpInspector` in
//! [`crate::PrincepsEvmFactory::create_evm`]) is a deliberate
//! follow-up — it touches every block execution in Reth and needs
//! its own integration pass.
//!
//! ### Process-global caveat
//!
//! Like every precompile-globals consumer in this crate, the guard
//! assumes single-EVM-at-a-time execution. Parallel EVMs would
//! trample each other's snapshots — the same caveat that motivates
//! the `#[ignore]` annotations on the Stage 17f end-to-end tests.
