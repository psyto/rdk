//! `openhl-node` — integration coordinator for the openhl L1 (Stage 13).
//!
//! No new state machines, no new pure-compute primitives. This crate
//! is the **composition layer**: it owns one [`OracleState`], one
//! [`LiquidationScanner`] (with its [`InsuranceFund`]), and one
//! [`VaultState`], and runs them through the per-block tick that
//! `crates/liquidation/src/lib.rs` documents as "the bridge's
//! per-block flow." Stage 13 lifts that comment into actual code.
//!
//! ### What `tick` does
//!
//! Each block the bridge calls [`OpenHlNode::tick`] with:
//!   - `block_time` / `block_height` — current chain time/height.
//!   - `mark` — the current top-of-book mark price (from the CLOB).
//!   - `account_snapshots` — every non-flat account in the market
//!     (the bridge assembles these from its position table).
//!   - `vault_total_assets` — the vault's current asset value
//!     (collateral + marked `PnL`), computed off-tick by the bridge
//!     from the vault's own positions.
//!
//! The tick then:
//!   1. **Refreshes the oracle** (if the configured interval has
//!      elapsed since the last refresh). Stale-feed filter + median
//!      + deviation guard from `rdk_oracle`.
//!   2. **Scans for liquidations** using [`LiquidationScanner::scan`].
//!      Liquidatable / Underwater accounts produce close orders and
//!      mutate the insurance fund.
//!   3. **Runs ADL** if `ScanReport::unfilled_deficit > 0` and the
//!      config opted in. Profitable counter-positions are ranked and
//!      haircut via [`execute_adl`].
//!   4. **Marks the vault to market** by pushing the bridge-computed
//!      `vault_total_assets` into [`VaultState::mark_to_market`]. No
//!      shares are minted or burned — only NAV per share moves.
//!
//! Funding settlement is **not** part of `tick` — it's per-position
//! and happens on the funding clock's own cadence, called by the
//! bridge separately. The bridge layer composes both as it sees fit.
//!
//! ### What `tick` does NOT do
//!
//! - **Submit close orders to the CLOB.** `tick` produces a
//!   `ScanReport` whose `records` carry close-order specs; the bridge
//!   submits them to the matching engine. Keeping the coordinator
//!   side-effect-free against the CLOB lets it stay a pure
//!   state-machine driver.
//! - **Apply ADL bookkeeping mutations.** Same reason — `tick`
//!   produces an `AdlReport` whose records the bridge applies to its
//!   own position/balance tables.
//! - **Halt the chain on unresolvable deficit.** If `tick` returns
//!   `adl.deficit_remaining > 0`, the bridge decides whether to halt
//!   or accept protocol loss per deployment policy. Stage 13 doesn't
//!   make that policy call.
//!
//! ### Why no Reth boot here
//!
//! Booting Reth + the consensus bridge is `crates/evm`'s
//! `LiveRethEvmBridge` (in production-shape since Stage 9d).
//! `openhl-node` is one level above that: the per-block state-machine
//! driver that the bridge calls into. Splitting the Reth-side
//! composition (in `evm`) from the openhl-side composition (here)
//! keeps each layer independently testable. The `bin/openhl` binary
//! will own wiring of these two layers together.
