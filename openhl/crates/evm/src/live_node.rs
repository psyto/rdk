//! `LiveRethEvmBridge` — `ConsensusBridge` backed by a real Reth provider.
//!
//! Stage 7b: parent lookups go through the live node's provider via the
//! `BlockNumReader` trait.
//!
//! Stage 7c: `validate_payload` runs Reth's `EthBeaconConsensus::
//! validate_header_against_parent` against the live parent — that's real
//! header validation (number monotonicity, timestamp monotonicity, gas-limit
//! drift, base-fee math) using production Reth code.
//!
//! Stage 8d: the bridge now owns a CLOB matching engine. `submit_order` routes
//! orders into the book and accumulates resulting fills in `pending_fills`.
//! `build_payload` drains the pending fills and stores them alongside the
//! synthesized header, so the payload carries real CLOB-generated content.
//! Fills are not yet encoded as EVM transactions executable by Reth's
//! `BlockExecutor` — that's the next stage (or Module 3). 8d proves the
//! wiring exists; encoding is downstream.
//!
//! Stage 7d: `commit` now sends a `ForkchoiceUpdated` to Reth's in-process
//! consensus engine when an engine handle has been installed. The bridge
//! still maintains its own `chain` `HashMap` as the source of truth for
//! validation lookups — Reth's response (VALID/SYNCING/INVALID) is logged
//! but does not yet block the commit, because `build_payload` doesn't
//! produce a real `ExecutionPayload` for the engine to validate against.
//! Honest scoping: the wire is connected; payload-execution alignment is
//! the next chunk of work (depends on encoding CLOB fills as EVM txs).
//!
//! Still stubbed:
//!   - Full block execution + state-root verification (waits on fills being
//!     encoded as EVM-executable transactions, then `newPayload` round-trip)
