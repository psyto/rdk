//! Custom REVM precompiles that expose CLOB state to EVM execution.
//!
//! Stage 9b — live CLOB state. The precompile reads from a process-global
//! `Arc<Mutex<Book>>` that the bridge installs at construction. Hardcoded
//! values from 9a are gone; smart contracts now see real best-bid data.
//!
//! ### Why a process-global, not a closure-captured reference
//!
//! REVM's `PrecompileFn = fn(&[u8], u64, u64) -> PrecompileResult` is a
//! **function pointer**, not an `Fn` closure. Function pointers can't capture
//! environment, so the only way to get per-instance state into the precompile
//! is via global storage. The trade-off: only one CLOB can be installed
//! per process. For single-validator openhl deployments that's fine. Future
//! REVM versions may expand the precompile signature; until then, the global
//! is load-bearing infrastructure.
//!
//! Precompile address conventions:
//!   - openhl reserves the range `0x0000...0c1b` upwards (mnemonic: "CLB")
//!   - addresses 1-9 are Ethereum's standard precompiles (ECDSA recover etc.)
//!   - we stay well above those to avoid collisions
